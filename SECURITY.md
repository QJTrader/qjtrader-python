## Verifying release authenticity

Every `qjtrader` release on PyPI is published straight from this repository's GitHub Actions workflow
via [PyPI Trusted Publishing](https://docs.pypi.org/trusted-publishers/) — **no API tokens, no manual
uploads**. Each release file carries a [PEP 740](https://peps.python.org/pep-0740/) digital
attestation, so you can cryptographically confirm it was built by
`QJTrader/qjtrader-python` and not tampered with:

- The **Provenance** section on the [PyPI project page](https://pypi.org/project/qjtrader/) shows the
  signing GitHub workflow.
- Programmatic verification is available through PyPI's
  [Integrity API](https://docs.pypi.org/api/integrity/).

If a release lacks provenance or its attestation does not resolve to this repository, do not trust
it — please report it via the channel above.
